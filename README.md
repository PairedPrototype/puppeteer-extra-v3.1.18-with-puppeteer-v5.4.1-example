# Puppeteer-Extra (v3.1.18) with Puppeteer (v5.4.1) example

Just an example of how I cast the types between the Pupeteer and Puppeteer-Extra packages.

# How to run the example

1. Clone this repo
1. Navigate to the repo root
1. Run `npm i`
1. Run `npm start`

This will load up the CodePen.io website, fetch the content of the `<head>` tag
and display it in the console, then exit.
